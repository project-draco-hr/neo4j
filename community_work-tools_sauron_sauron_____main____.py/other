' Sauron.\n\nMegalomaniac ruler of the underworld. Also, utility bot for automating basic engineering tasks. Breaks all rules about\nSRP and unix command line tools.\n\nCredentials:\n  Login to trello can either be provided via the command line, or in a config file in ~/.sauron\n\n  It should look something like:\n  trello_api_key: \'API_KEY_GOES_HERE\'\n  trello_user_token: \'TOKEN_FOR_USER_ACCOUNT_TO_USE\'\n\nCapabilities:\n\n  Tracking deprecation:\n    Updates a trello ticket with a list of deprecated things that should be removed. Picks up the current version\n    from pom.xml from the directory sauron is invoked in, and checks for @Deprecated things in the repository that\n    were added more than <versions_back> before the current version.\n\n  Maintaining mordor:\n    Tracks a set of trello lists, and maintains a single board showing all cards that are those lists. This\n    can be used to get an overview, for example, of what is "in dev" across multiple trello boards.\n    \n    You can either specify what board to use as mordor and what lists to track directly on the command line,\n    or in the config file. If you specify in the config file, you can just call sauron mordor.\n    \n    Configuration should look like (~/.sauron):\n    \n    mordor:\n        board: \'MORDOR_BOARD_ID\'\n        lists:\n        [\n          \'LIST_ID\'\n          \'LIST_ID\'\n          \'LIST_ID\'\n        ]\n\n  Trello maintenence:\n    Currently some basic tasks to list boards and lists via command line. Can be used to get list ids to use for\n    maintaining mordor.\n\n\n\nUsage:\n  sauron mordor\n  sauron mordor <mordor_board_id> from <track_list_id>... [options]\n  sauron trello boards [options]\n  sauron trello lists [<board_id>] [options]\n  sauron deprecations <github_repo_url> <board_id> <list_id>\n  sauron deprecations before <git_tag>\n  sauron deprecations after <git_tag>\n  sauron deprecations removed between <one_git_tag> and <second_git_tag>\n\n\nOptions:\n  -h --help                       Show this screen.\n  --version                       Show version.\n  --trellokey=<trello_key>        Trello API key for this script [Default: None]\n  --trellotoken=<trello_token>    Trello read/write token for the user to act as [Default: None]\n\n'
